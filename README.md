# Environmental Track - Eco Track

This is an [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), aimed at tracking and promoting environmental sustainability.

## Project Overview

Eco Track is a web application designed to help users monitor their environmental impact, track sustainability efforts, and learn about eco-friendly practices. Our goal is to make environmental consciousness accessible and engaging for everyone.

## Features

- User dashboard for tracking personal environmental impact
- Community challenges and leaderboards
- Educational resources on sustainability
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time environmental data collection
- Data visualization of environmental metrics

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a custom font for improved readability and aesthetics.
